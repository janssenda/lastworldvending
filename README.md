Last World Vending

                Lost world vending is a vending machine simulator based on java, spring-jsp/jstl, and
                a mysql back end. The app is themed as a dystopian, fallout-style machine to give the
                user a sense of nostalgia and mystery. There are 9 menu items to choose from. You can
                enable realism mode (if you dare) for some frustrating outcomes and the chance to shake
                the machine!

                The app consists of a standard MVC profile and was adapted from a simple console version
                to a richer web experience using Spring and was deployed as a standard tomcat web app.
                Since browser compatibility was not a concern during this project, Chrome or safari are
                recommended for the best viewing experience.
